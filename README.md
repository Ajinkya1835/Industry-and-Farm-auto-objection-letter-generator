# 🧠 Smart Objection Letter Generator using n8n + AI

A self-hosted project that automatically generates and emails **environmental objection letters** to violators based on citizen and official reports.

## 🌍 Overview
Citizens and officials submit environmental violation reports via a simple frontend form.  
These entries are verified by an official, stored as structured datasets, and then processed through an **n8n workflow** that:
1. Cleans the data,
2. Compares entries with Indian environmental laws,
3. Generates objection letters automatically, and
4. Sends them via email to the violators and corresponding officials.

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **Frontend**: Static form for citizen/official submissions  
- **Backend / Automation**: n8n running in Docker  
- **Dataset**: Verified CSV files (`violators.csv`, `laws_india.csv`)  
- **Mailer**: n8n SMTP node for sending autogenerated objection letters  
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted on Ubuntu Server with Cloudflare Tunnel access
